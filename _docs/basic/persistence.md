# Persistence

{% include alert.html type="info" title='What is persistence?' content='Never lose any changes in your files even after a Browser restart. Any edits and settings will be stored in the Browser.' %}

Even after a page refresh or Browser restart, every change in your encoding and all your settings will be restored. This is made possible through the Browser's local storage that keeps stored information for a given URL persistently. mei-friend safes every change in the encoding and all settings in local storage and will restore it upon page refresh and Browser restart.

Local storage size may depend on your Browser and is normally around 5 MB. Files exceeding this capacity cannot be stored anymore. In this case, a red warning message will appear next to the file name in the menu bar. You may then still edit your files, but be aware that unsafed changes will disappear after a page refresh or Browser restart.

{% include alert.html type="primary" title='Limitation' content='At the momement, mei-friend will create a local storage session per URL. If you have two pnae' %}
