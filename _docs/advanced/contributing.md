# Contributing to mei-friend    

We are grateful for contributions to the mei-friend project in the following areas: 

1. Bug reports, 
2. Feature requests, 
3. Contributing encodings to the public repertoire, 
4. Contributing translation fixes and new translations, and 
5. Contributing to the mei-friend codebase.

Note that the first three items do not require any programming knowledge and are accessible to all users of mei-friend: you can contribute to the project by simply using it and providing feedback through the [code repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/mei-friend/mei-friend/issues/new/choose), also available through mei-friend's `Help -> Provide feedback` menu item.
