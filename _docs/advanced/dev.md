# Developing mei-friend    

## Feedback

Even though we spend a lot of time on making sure that everything works smoothly, there will be bugs that we have not discovered yet. 
So, if you discover a behavior in mei-friend that does not seem to be the intended behavior (i.e. a bug), please report it to us so by raising an issue on GitHub so that we can work on it.

To raise an issue on GitHub, either go directly to the [mei-friend GitHub repository](https://github.com/mei-friend/mei-friend/), 
or when inside the mei-friend user interface, select the menu bar item ``Help &ndash; Provide feedback´´. 
This will guide you to the screen shown in Figure 1 below.
