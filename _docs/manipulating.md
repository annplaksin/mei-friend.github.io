# Manipulating 

Mei-friend provides some useful tools to manipulate your score or specific elements (under `Manipulate` in the menu bar) in it besides the straight forward ones already discussed in [editing](_docs\editing.md).

## Vertical Groups

If you want some elements in your score to be aligned vertically select all of them and use `Add vertical group` or hotkey "v". This adds the attribute `vgrp` with an unused group number to your elements. Elements with the same group number will be aligned. A typical case would be a hairpin-dynamic connection as seen in the screenshot with the crescendo-forte (left with vertical group, right without).
