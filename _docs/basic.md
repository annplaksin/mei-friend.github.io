## MEI basic concepts

MEI-Friend is a online tool designed to work with and edit MEI (Music Encoding Initiative). MEI is an xml-based encoding language that supports most western music notation from mensural notation, to tablature to modern music notation (Common Music Notation, CMN). In short MEI tries to encode music notation in a machine-readable structure. 
If you don't know how MEI works or have never worked with xml-tpye languages there are very beginner friendly tutorials [here] (https://music-encoding.org/resources/tutorials.html){:target="_blank"}. You can also find a thorough documentation [here] (https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/){:target="_blank"}.

MEI-friend is not designed to write MEI by hand but to import an already existing MEI file (that was converted from musicXML for example) and edit and correct it with this tool.

## Application screen regions

MEI-friend has two major screen regions: the editor panel and the notation panel. The editor panel is where the MEI encoding is displayed and the notation panel where it is rendered. These two panels are always connected so that every change that is made in one of them will result in a change also in the other one.
