# Shown to the user

description: A sentence.
# Not necessarily shown to the user,
# but used for HTML metadata if jekyll-seo-tag is enabled

tags: [Ruby, Python, RFC, "<some_namespace_id>:<appropriate_tag>"]
# NOTE: Avoid whitespaces and other characters that may make Jekyll
# percent-encode the tag in URLs. Replace " " (a regular space)
# with "_" (underline); underlines will be rewritten as spaces when tags
# are presented to site users.
# Tag can be prepended with a namespace to signify the type,
# e.g. chosen programming language or target viewer audience
# (see hub site configuration for tag namespace setup).
# Avoid long namespace/tag combos as they can overflow item’s card widget.

#   ietf.org/html/rfcN, datatracker.ietf.org/doc/…
# * Order links according to importance for project site visitors.
#   The first link will be highlighted as primary.

feature_with_priority: 1
# With this key, software or spec will be featured on home
# page of project site. Lower number means higher priority
# (as in, priority no. 1 means topmost item on home page,
# as long as there aren’t others with the same value).
# If no documents in the collection have this key,
# items on home will be ordered according to Jekyll’s
# default behavior.
