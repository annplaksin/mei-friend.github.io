Welcome to the mei-friend Help pages. Here you will find documentation for the mei-friend "last-mile" music encoding editor. 
mei-friend is intended to alleviate the common task of cleaning up encodings in the [Music Encoding Initiative](https://music-encoding.org/){:target="_blank"}'s (MEI) XML format. 
These may be generated via optical music recognition, or via conversion from other formats. mei-friend is a full-featured, cross-browser compatible Web application, with optimised performance and an extended set of features. The application is available online at https://mei-friend.mdw.ac.at.

In the navigation menu, you will find:
- A cheatsheet with a comprehensive list of editing functions and their keyboard shortcuts
- A quickstart guide presenting a short tutorial 
- The documentation itself describing basic and advanced topics and giving pointers to further reading
- More information about the development of mei-friend
- Latest news about the project
